# Intro

This is a very basic test using the very cool [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) where the idea is to split a long text into tweets creating a tweetstorm. The same idea was used to create the [cli nodejs version](https://github.com/fantunes/tweet-split)

## How to run

Simply run `npm install`, then `node app.js` and go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). That's it, really.
